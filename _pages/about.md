I am an interdisciplinary researcher focusing on how AI systems replicate and amplify societal bias. By integrating methods from NLP, cognitive science, and AI ethics, I analyze the structural and conceptual foundations of bias in large language models, with an emphasis on interpretability and socio-technical mitigation strategies.
